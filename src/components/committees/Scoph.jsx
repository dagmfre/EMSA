          The Standing Committee on Public Health (SCOPH) is one of the six
          standing committees of EMSA. The committee aims to allow medical
          students learn, build skills, cooperate, explore, and share ideas when
          it comes to addressing issues related to public health. SCOPH is
          responsible for disease prevention within our society, health
          promotion and education in our community as well as raising awareness
          about global public health issues within medical students and our
          society.

            The Standing Committee on Public Health (SCOPH) brings together
            medical students from all over the world to learn, build skills,
            cooperate, explore and share ideas to address all issues related to
            Public Health, including Global Health issues, health policies,
            health promotion, and education activities. <br />
            <br />
            Medical students of the IFMSA formed the Standing Committee on
            Studentsâ€™ Health (SCOSH) in 1952, driven by a strong will to take an
            active part in preventing and making policies concerning health
            problems. During the following years, the wide variety of activities
            led to the change of SCOSH to the Standing Committee on Health
            (SCOH) in 1963.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1983 the name of the Committee changed once more to the Standing
            Committee on Public Health (SCOPH). <br /> <br /> During these six
            decades, SCOPHeroes have implemented, maintained and improved a wide
            variety of community-based projects on a local, national and
            international level. Through these activities, we are pursuing our
            vision of a healthy society and we are developing our own potential
            of being complete and skillful health professionals.
