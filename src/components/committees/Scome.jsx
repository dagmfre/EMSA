        <h1>Medical Education (SCOME)</h1>
        <p>
          Medical Education should be a concern of every medical student as it
          shapes not only the quality of future doctors but also the quality of
          healthcare. The International Federation of Medical Studentsâ€™
          Associations (IFMSA) has a dedicated organ which aims to implement an
          optimal learning environment for all medical students around the
          world, the Standing Committee On Medical Education (SCOME). Through
          all our joint efforts we work to create sustainable changes around the
          world, for ourselves as medical students, for the generations to come
          and for our future patients and our communities who are in fact the
          final beneficiaries of our education.

            SCOME was one of IFMSAs first standing committees from the beginning
            of its foundation in 1951. It acts as a discussion forum for
            students interested in the different aspects of medical education in
            the hope of pursuing and achieving its aim. Today, SCOME works
            mainly in medical education capacity building.
          </p>
          <p>
            SCOME provides several platforms and methods to educate medical
            students worldwide on various medical education issues. Through this
            knowledge, it empowers them to advocate to be a part of the
            decision-making chain. SCOME believes in medical students as
            important stakeholders in creating, developing and implementing
            medical education systems.
