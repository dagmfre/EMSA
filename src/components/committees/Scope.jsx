          The Professional Exchange program is a full educational program
          offering clerkships to medical students abroad. Since the very
          beginning, in 1951, it was evident that exchange of medical students
          would be one of the main fields of action in IFMSA. As early as 1952,
          a total of 463 students spent a period of practice abroad, and today,
          it continues to be the backbone of the Federation and constitutes its
          longest running project. Annually, around 13.000 students from more
          than 90 countries travel around the world to discover new health
          systems, new cultures and to enhance their global health and
          intercultural understanding.

            The Standing Committee on Professional Exchange (SCOPE) was founded
            in 1951 and is one of the first standing committees within IFMSA. It
            started small, beginning with only 8 European countries, but since
            then has grown into one of the largest student-run exchange programs
            in the world, with around 13.000 medical students participating
            every year from more than 100 National Member Organizations.

            The SCOPE exchange program is a quality educational and cultural
            experience organized entirely by medical students with the help of
            their medical faculties.

          <p>
            The aim of SCOPE is to promote cultural understanding and
            co-operation amongst medical students and all health professionals,
            through the facilitation of international student exchanges. SCOPE
            aims to give all students the opportunity to learn about global
            health, and attains this partly by having its exchanges accredited
            by medical faculties across the world.
