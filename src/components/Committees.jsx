              IFMSA works on the local and national levels mainly via its six
              standing committees, each of them focusing on major health topics
              and medical student-related interests. Each Standing Committee is
              headed by an International Director, who is supported by an
              international team generally consisting of one Liaison Officer
              (who is responsible for communication with relevant external
              partners) and five Regional Assistants (one from each of IFMSAs
              five regions).
            </span>{" "}
            <br /> <br />
            <span>
              On the national level, the Standing Committee is coordinated by
              the National Officer, who is elected at each NMOs National General
              Assembly. On the local level the work is executed by one or more
              Local Officers. The International Director is the main responsible
              for the activities and capacity building of their standing
              committees.

              The Regional Assistants assume majorly the communications with the
              National and Local Officers of their respective regions. They are
              in charge of the standing committees sessions at their Regional
              Meetings, and can be asked, by the Director, to contribute to
              general tasks related to the development of their standing
              committee.

              The work of each standing committee is complemented by several
              activities, such as training, campaigns and advocacy efforts,
              offering youth the space to learn in both formal and non-formal
              educational settings.

              Thousands of projects, activities, conferences and workshops are
              organized each year internationally, nationally and locally
              through National Member Organizations within the IFMSA network in
              each area, allowing students to become agents of change at home.
